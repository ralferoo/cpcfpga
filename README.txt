This is the CPC FPGA project - a modern reimplementation of the Amstrad CPC
on an FPGA.

Whilst it's designed for use with the Amstrad CPC, the board could be
used for almost any 8-bit system. Alternatively, it could be used as a
cheap FPGA development board that includes a SCART socket, RAM, flash ROM,
PS/2 keyboard, twin joystick ports, tape input, etc...

Note that the public repo is a partial snapshot of the private repo. In
particular, whilst I'm making the schematic available, the board layout
is private for now whilst it's still under development.
