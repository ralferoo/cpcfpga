SRAM chip is 4Mbit = 512KB, flash chip is 4Mbit = 512KB or 16Mbit = 2MB

512KB = 8 x 64KB or 32 x 16KB

RAM layout:

    64K base CPC RAM
    64K alt system RAM (for menus etc)
8 x 16K 8 ROM images
   256K RAM expansion, as per DK tronics

ROM layout:

7 x 64K ROM / disk image space
    64K standard ROM and boot image space

A25L040 has protection on block 7 (protected area 0x70000-0x7FFFF)
    16K firmware image		#78000
    16K BASIC image		#74000
    16K AMSDOS image		#70000
    16K boot image		#7c000

S25FL016K has a much more flexible system, enabling any power of 2 from 4KB
upwards from either top or bottom to be protected. It's also really cheap, so
it makes sense to just use it. :)


FPGA RAM translation table from "disk" sectors to SD card sectors:

40 tracks, 2 sides, 11 SPT = 880 sectors

      6 bits track
      1 bit side
      8 bytes sector ID
     32 bits per sector address 	-9 for sector xlat (4GB card max)
     --
     47 bits, 6 bytes per sector	-> 36 bits per sector

So, we could index the base addresses of 1024 sectors with arbitrary ids
as we have 8 * 4608 RAM blocks
