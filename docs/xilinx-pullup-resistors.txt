Xilinx Spartan 3 â€“ a special case!

   With the original Xilinx Spartan 3 family of FPGAs (not the subsequent
   Spartan 3A or Spartan 3E families), configuring the FPGA with all pins
   set to "Float" has been found to significantly increase the device's
   current consumption.  Therefore, to get the best test coverage whilst
   avoiding this problem, the 'blank' FPGA image for these devices should
   float pins that are connected to external pull resistors but enable the
   internal pull resistors on all other pins.
