Atmega PC7 is connected to TDI, would be more useful as CLKO

KEYCOL4..KEYCOL7 don't have pull-ups
JOY1_{FIRE,LEFT,RIGHT,SPARE} has double pull-ups

HDMI SCL,SDA,CEC don't have pull-ups
TFP410PAP SCL,SDA don't have pull-ups

PS/2 level conversion still has 2 different implementations, one works with
the squishy keyboards only, the other with the clicky keyboards only. WHY?

HDMI connector holes should be through plated so they can be soldered downm

Mini USB locator pins are too close

VCC and GND traces are only 0.4mm, next revision make these at least 0.6mm

TAPE_IN should have pull up resistors
arguably all the GPIO pins should too
