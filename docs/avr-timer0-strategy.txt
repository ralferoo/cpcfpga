We want to operate the SD card at 400kHz (so clock low and high every 20 cycles
if running at 8MHz).

10 cycles is barely enough time to deal properly with the interrupts:
	2 cycles to push PC to stack
	3 cycles to jump to interrupt routine
	...
	5 cycles for RETI

However, doing AVR stuff via interrupts might be good so we can also do other
things.

Using timer0:

Set OCR0A to 255-11
Set WGM0[2:0]=2
Set TCNT0 to 255-21 this will trigger OCR0A interrupt 10 cycles later

When TCNT0 = 255-11, it will reset to 0 and then re-trigger interrupt 244
cycles later, but that's fine.

20 $0026 TIMER0 COMPA Timer/Counter0 Compare Match A

This is called at least 10 cycles after the initial routine, but can safely
be much later.

SD_CLK=low
Set TCNT to 255-10, as this will trigger an overflow before OCR0A
RETI

Now, hopefully we'll receive the next interrupt about 10 cycles later:

22 $002A TIMER0 OVF Timer/Counter0 Overflow

process SD data
SD_CLK=high

Set TCND to 255-20
Set TIFR0=(1<<OCF0A)|(1<<TOV0) to make sure we have at least 10 clocks
RETI

In worst case, we'll have 2 OCR0A interrupts in a row without having serviced
to OVF interrupt. In this case, we'll waste 10 cycles in OCR0 interrupt but
the proceed directly to the OCF interrupt.

Maybe it'd be simpler to just do 10 cycles of work in that routine...
